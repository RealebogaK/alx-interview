0x09. Island Perimeter

* 2D Arrays (Matrices):
 1. Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
 2. Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

* Conditional Logic:
 1. Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

* Counting Techniques:
 1. Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

* Problem-Solving Strategies:
 1. Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

* Python Programming:
 1. Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
 2. Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
